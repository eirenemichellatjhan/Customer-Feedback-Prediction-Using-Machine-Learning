# Customer-Feedback-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

In this project, my team and I developed a deep learning model to predict whether a mobile application is at risk of violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). With the increasing number of children using mobile apps, protecting their data privacy is critical. The project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify apps as either “at risk” or “not at risk” based on features such as app category, user audience, and privacy policies.

The goal was not only to detect potential COPPA violations but also to identify the underlying factors contributing to these risks, supporting safer app development and better data-driven policy decisions.
